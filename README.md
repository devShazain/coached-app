Coached started as a venture capital simulation where I pitched a high-growth startup idea to VC firms for a pre-seed investment. The process began with crafting a compelling pitch deck, presenting the business model, market opportunity, and growth potential.

To bring the idea to life, I then designed and built a one-page website with the goal of convincing viewers that the product is worth buying â€” quickly and effectively. The website is developed in React, styled with Tailwind CSS, and enhanced with Framer Motion animations for a smooth and modern user experience. It showcases the service, pricing, customer reviews, and includes a simple order form to simulate the conversion funnel.
